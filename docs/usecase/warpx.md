Supercomputing and high-performance computing (HPC) are redefining the frontiers of science and innovation—and the Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is at the heart of this transformation. By combining cutting-edge hardware with next-generation software, the ECP is unlocking the ability to explore scientific challenges that were once thought to be out of reach.

One such advancement is the integration of ParaView Catalyst with AMReX-based solvers. While Catalyst was previously embedded within the MFix-Exa multiphase fluid dynamics code, its use was limited to that single application. That’s no longer the case. With newly expanded support for AMReX and WarpX, Catalyst’s powerful in situ visualization capabilities are now accessible across a broader range of physics simulations—bringing interactive insight to more domains than ever before.
