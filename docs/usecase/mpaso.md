MPAS-Ocean is a state-of-the-art ocean modeling system developed by the COSIM project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, built to simulate ocean dynamics across vast temporal and spatial scales—from sub-kilometer coastal processes to global circulations, and from seasonal trends to millennial climate patterns. This level of range and resolution makes MPAS-Ocean a vital tool for advancing our understanding of ocean behavior and its role in Earth’s climate system.

To enhance the interpretability and communication of these complex simulations, ParaView Catalyst was employed to generate a rich sequence of in situ visualizations, which were later assembled into an interactive cinematic experience. This cinematic approach offers researchers an intuitive, immersive way to explore the evolution of large-scale ocean phenomena, identify patterns, and share findings with both scientific collaborators and broader audiences—without the need to store or post-process massive datasets.
