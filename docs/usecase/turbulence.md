Taming turbulence at supersonic speeds is one of the major challenges in modern aeronautics. In this high-fidelity simulation, researchers explored how  tiny surface features called micro-ramps can influence turbulent flow over aircraft traveling faster than the speed of sound. Tackling this problem required solving equations on colossal meshes with up to 30 billion cells. ParaView Catalyst was integral to the effort, enabling real-time, in situ visualizations that brought the complex flow structures to life and provided critical insights without the need for storing massive datasets.
